 <p> ArrayList is a dynamic array and we do not have to specify the size while creating it, the size of the array automatically increases when we dynamically add and remove items. Though the actual library implementation may be more complex, the following is a very basic idea explaining the working of the array when the array becomes full and if we try to add an item:

      Creates a bigger-sized memory on heap memory (for example memory of double size).

      Copies the current memory elements to the new memory.

      The new item is added now as there is bigger memory available now.

      Delete the old memory.</p>
